# Bitcoin Chat

A hackable chat that runs on the bitcoin blockchain. Intended as a starting point for developers to build on top of.

The chat needs no database backend because all data is stored on a Bitcoin blockchain (it currently runs on LTC testnet). The interface between the chat and the blockchain is provided by [Bitcoin Computer](https://bitcoincomputer.io)

## Start the chat

Clone the repo and run

````
yarn start
````

To log into the chat you need a BIP39 seed phrase. You can generate a new seed for example from [here](https://iancoleman.io/bip39/). You then need to fund the wallet using a [LTC faucet](https://testnet-faucet.com/ltc-testnet/)

For more information see the [Bitcoin Computer Docs](https://docs.bitcoincomputer.io/getting-started/run-in-a-browser) or ask in the [Telegram Group](https://t.me/joinchat/FMrjOUWRuUkNuIt7zJL8tg).

## Contributing

The chat is very bare bones and contributions are more than welcome. Have a look at the open issues, or make a pull request with a new feature. You can also request a feature request by creating an issue.
